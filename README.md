# Valeria-Popolla

This is my first homework of the ADM class, a course I am attending as a Data Science student.
I have not a computer science backround so most of the excercises were difficut to me to solve and because of that I had to take a look at the documetation, tutorials and other similar things to try to improve my skills. I did what I could and I came up with two fils: the first one named Submissions.pdf conteins the submissions from Hakerrank and the second one named HM1.py with my solutions.
