## Hi there! 
I would like to introduce myself, I am Valeria, 24 yo, I've studied Management Statstics and I'm currently studying Data Science at Sapienza Univeristy of Rome. In the repository, you can find some of my works. Mostly, they are projects from the Univeristy but I think they represent topics I like working on and abilities in data analysis and drafting reports.
