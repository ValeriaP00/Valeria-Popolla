## Hi there! 
I would like to introduce myself, I am Valeria, 24 yo, I've studied Management Statistics and I'm currently studying Data Science at Sapienza Univeristy of Rome. In the repository, you can find some of my works. Mostly, they are projects from the Univeristy but they represent topics I worked on and abilities in data analysis and drafting reports.
