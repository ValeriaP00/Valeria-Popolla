## Hi there! 
I would like to introduce myself, I am Valeria, 23 yo, currently studying Data Science in Sapienza Univeristy of Rome. In the repository, you can find some of my works. Mostly, they are projects from the Univeristy but I think they represent topics I like working on and abilities in data analysis and drafting reports.
